1.  **Defense in Depth**: e.g. MFA -&gt; VPN -&gt; Password
2.  **Least Privilege**: only give required privilege
3.  **Seperation of Duties**: one thing can be done via two or more actors
4.  **Secure by Design**: make security from start to end
5.  **KISS**: the complexity of security system will make it unsecure

<!--listend-->

1.  **NOT Security by Obscurity**: Kerckhoffs's principle
    e.g. AES and RSA encrypting algorithms

**Summary**: greate for making security desisions
